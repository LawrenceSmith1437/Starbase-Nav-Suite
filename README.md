# Nav-Suite
An integration and minor tweaking of Archaegeo's Waypointing, Firestar99's Compass, FixerID's Autopilot, and a couple utility scrips that I place pretty regularly.

The majority of this work is originally done by the authors posted above. Here are links to their original projects but do note that they are not obligated to help you figure out how this version works. These are here for reference and comparison.

How to install: Download the .fbe, put chips in slots, attach buttons, place receivers in downward L pattern as referenced in FixerID's wiki. Ensure your FCU, binds, and levers use the 3 letter standard in the example FCU. Set FWD lever re-center field to CRUS. Make sure things are named appropriately as per the .fbe. A list of all global variables used is avaiable, but may not be complete. Tune the autopilot as per navCas wiki.

How to use: Stop the ship. Enter a waypoint either by saving and/or selecting it then Loading it via Archageos Waypointing system. Press nav to go there or point at it manually with compass and go yourself.
